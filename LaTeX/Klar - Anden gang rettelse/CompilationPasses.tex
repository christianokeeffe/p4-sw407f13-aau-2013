\subsection{Compilation passes}
The compiler in this project consists of several passes. First, the scanner scans the program, and returns the result to the parser, which generates the parse tree. The lexer and parser is both generated by ANTLR \citep{ANTLR} from the BNF of the SPLAD-language (see section \ref{sec:bnf}). The parse tree serves as input to the type checker, which checks that the source-program complies to the type-rules. Next, the code-generator generates the code for the Arduino. It is also in the code-generating phase, the scope-rules are being checked. Because of lack of time, there is not optimizing phase.
