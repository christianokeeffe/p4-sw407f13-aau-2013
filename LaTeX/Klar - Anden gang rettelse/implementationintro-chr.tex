This chapter will be about how the compiler will be implemented and which decisions there have been taken regarding the implementation. There will be looked at existing lexer and parser generators. Based on these observations it will be decided if a existing solution should be used or if lexer and parser should be made from scratch.

After this decision there will be sections about the different parts of the compiler and tests of the complete build.
