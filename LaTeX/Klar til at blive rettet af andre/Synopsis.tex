This report contains a description of the environment where drinks are an essential part, and this leads to the following problem statement:
"How can a programming language be developed, which makes it suitable for the hobby programmer to program drink machines based on Arduino platforms?"
The product of this project is a programming language with a compiler which can make it easier to program a machine that can mix and serve drinks. The program language's syntax is written in BNF and the compiler is developed using the parser and lexer generator ANTLR. Lastly unit testing is used to give a better overview of the code coverage of the compiler code.
