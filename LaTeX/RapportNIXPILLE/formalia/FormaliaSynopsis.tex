This report starts off with a description of an environment where drinks are an essential part, this leads to the following problem statement:
"How can a programming language be developed, which makes it suitable for the hobbyist programmer to program drinks machines based on Arduino platforms?"
The product of this project is a programming language with a compiler which can make it easier to program a machine which can mix and serve drinks. The syntax of the program language is written in BNF and the compiler is developed using the parser and lexer generator ANTLR. Lastly, unit testing is used to test certain parts of the compiler to see if they work as intended. It has been concluded that this project gives a fulfilling answer to the problem stated in this project.
