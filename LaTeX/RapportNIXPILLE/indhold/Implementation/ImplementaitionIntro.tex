This chapter will describe the process of implementing a compiler. First we evaluate the criteria of the compiler, then we look at the architecture in this case the hardware which we will use in this project. A general overview of the compiler phases will be described followed by the syntactic and contextual analysis as well as the code generation. Lastly we show the setup of how a drinks machine could look like albeit only with LED substituting the containers.
