This chapter describes the process of implementing a compiler. First we evaluate the criteria of the compiler, then we look at the architecture in this case the hardware which we use in this project. A general overview of the compiler phases is described followed by the syntactic, contextual analysis and code generation. Lastly we show the setup of how a drinks machine could look like albeit with LEDs substituting the containers.
