\section{Syntactic Analysis}
\label{syntactic}
Syntactic analysis is the first phase of the compilation process from SPLAD to the C/C++ like language Arduino uses. It consists of a lexer and a parser. The syntactic analyzer read through the SPLAD program and checks if the program complies with the syntax specification of SPLAD and if it does, it creates a parse tree which is used by the contextual analysis.

The parser and lexer in the SPLAD-compiler is generated by ANTLR \citep{ANTLR}, this can be seen on listing \ref{lst:generatP}. The first function to be used is the lexer, which can be seen on line 8. Here it can be seen that the lexer needs the program code. Next, The tokens are generated, this can be seen on line 9. It is clear that the token generator needs the output generated by the lexer when creating the tokens. When making the parser the tokens are needed, this can be seen on line 10. The tokens can be seen in section \ref{tab:tokens}.
