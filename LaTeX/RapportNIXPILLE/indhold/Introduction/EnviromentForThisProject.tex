\section{Environment for this Project}
The environment in this project is an Arduino-based drinks-machine. The basic idea behind this environment, is that the drinks-machine resides in a bar or to a party, where customers will buy RFID-tags, which contains information about a specific drink. These RFID-tags can be read by the drinks-machine by a RFID-reader. The machine will then automatically mix the drink on the RFID-tag.
