\subsection{Programming an Arduino-based Drinks-mixer}
To make it easier to program a drinks machine, it would be nice to have a programming language aimed specifically at this. See chapter \ref{chap:intro} for a description of the problem. Based on this it has been decided to make a programming language aimed at the stated problem. The is called SPLAD which stands for: \textbf{S}imple \textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguage for \textbf{A}rduino \textbf{D}rink-mixer. The SPLAD is described more thoroughly in section \ref{sec:problemstatement}.
