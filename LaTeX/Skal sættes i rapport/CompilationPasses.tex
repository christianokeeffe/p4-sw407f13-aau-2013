\subsection{Compilation phases}
The compiler in this project consists of several phases. First, the scanner scans the program, and returns the result to the parser, which generates the parse tree. The lexer and parser is both generated by ANTLR \citep{ANTLR} from the BNF of the SPLAD-language (see section \ref{sec:bnf} for the bnf). The parse tree serves as input to the type checker, which checks that the source-program complies according to the type-rules. Next, the code-generator generates the code for the Arduino platform. It is also in the code-generating phase, the scope-rules are being checked. Due to lack of time, there is no optimizing phase.
