\section{Prolog}
This report was written by Aleksander S. Nilsson, Christian J. O'Keeffe, Kasper Plejdrup, Niels  B. Pedersen, Mette T. Pedersen and Rasmus F. Gadensgaard as a 4th semester project. We are a group of students from the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University (AAU). This report will document and describe the process of designing and implementing a compiler.

The references in the report will be in the format [example] with a corresponding entry in the bibliography in the back of the report just before the appendix. Figures and tables will be referred to in this manner: Table 3.5, where the first number is the chapter and the second number is the number of the figure or table in that chapter.

The disc included on the last page of the report contains the complete source code of the compiler and a PDF version of the rapport.
