\section{Lexical analyzer}
A lexical analyzer reads the input file, and returns a series of tokens based based on the input. These tokens are matched by rules, usually described by regular expressions. An example of such grammar rules can be seen on ==

For example the line of code seen on \ref{??} might be read as the tokens:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	\hline
    Token     & Lexeme \\ \hline
    IDENT     & c      \\ 
    ASSIGN    & =      \\ 
    DIGIT     & 42     \\ 
    SEMICOLON & ;      \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{code}[Simple example of code,somecodeexample]
int c = 42;
\end{code}
