\subsection{Derivations}
Derivations is how the order the parser will make the parse tree, either it will be leftmost or it will be rightmost. Leftmost is where the parse tree will take derivations of the terminal that is the most left, where rightmost where the parse tree will take derivations of the terminal that is the most right.
