This report contains a description of the environment where drinks are an essential part, and this leads to the following problem statement:
"How can a programming language be developed, which makes it suitable for the hobby programmer to program drink machines based on Arduino platforms?"
The product of this project is a programming language with a compiler which can make it easier to program a machine that can mix and serve drinks. The syntax of the programming language is written in BNF and the compiler is developed using the parser and lexer generator ANTLR. Lastly unit testing is used to test certain parts of the compiler to see if they work as intended. There also is a section were we conclude on the project and see what could have done different.
