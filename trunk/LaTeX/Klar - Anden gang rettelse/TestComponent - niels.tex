\subsection{Test of program written in SPLAD}
This section contains a description of how the SPLAD compiler was tested in practice. The Arduino is built as seen on figure \ref{fig:HWsetup}. This is the setup which the was used as test station. A basic test program (see appendix \ref{chap:apptestprog}) was written, which implemented various ingredients and drinks. As it can be seen on \ref{fig:HWsetup}, no actual ingredients was used, instead a number of LED's were installed to act as containers of ingredients. When a LED is on, it means that the ingredient which is represented by the LED is added to the drink. The test was a success, and confirmed that all the input buttons, the RFID-reader/writer, the LED's and the LCD worked as intended, and the SPLAD compiler compiled the code, which could be compiled to the Arduino without problems.
