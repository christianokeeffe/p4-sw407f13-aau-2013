  note = {\url{http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt/scrypt.pdf} [Sidst set: 12/12/2012]},
  abstract = {We introduce the concepts of memory-hard algorithms and sequential
	memory-hard functions, and argue that in order for key derivation
	
	functions to be maximally secure against attacks using custom hardware,
	they
	
	should be constructed from sequential memory-hard functions. We present
	
	a family of key derivation functions which, under the random oracle
	model
	
	of cryptographic hash functions, are provably sequential memory-hard,
	and a
	
	variation which appears to be marginally stronger at the expense of
	lacking
	
	provable strength. Finally, we provide some estimates of the cost
	of performing brute force attacks on a variety of password strengths
	and key derivation
	
	functions.},
