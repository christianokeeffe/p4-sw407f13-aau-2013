\subsection{ANTLR}
ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a tool for generating a parser or lexer-parser from a given grammar. The ANTLR starts by generating the lexer based on the lexer rules that are defined in the grammar \citep{ANTLRLexer}. In SPLAD it has been decided, that a lexer rule should be written in all upper-case, compared to ANTLR's first letter upper-case lexer rules. This is done in order to distinguish better between lexer and parser rules when writing or reading the grammar. A lexer starts from the top of the rules and works its way down through the rules, meaning that it will try to generate tokens from the very first rule and work its way down until it meets a possible match between a given input and a rule. 
The token stream from the lexer is then parsed based on the parser rules that have been defined in the grammar. Parser rules are all written with lower-case in contrast to the lexer rules. ANTLR works with LL(*) grammars, which means that the parser uses left-most derivation to parse the token stream. ANTLR can generate a parse tree for the grammar by incorporating specific operators in the grammar which tells if an element should be a root node of a subtree with its children or if an element should be left out of the tree construction. ANTLR also allows the use of rewritten rules to generate a tree from the given grammar \citep{ANTLRTreeCon}.

The ANTLR library comes with a tool for testing the generated lexer and parser. The tool, (test rig), allows for parsing some code and gets it represented
in a GUI or tree representation. This has been done for a simple "Hello world" program, see listing \ref{lst:helloworldsplad}, to show how a program is parsed and represented using the GUI option.

On figure \ref{fig:parsecode} a parse tree for the "Hello world" program, which can be seen on listing \ref{lst:helloworldsplad}, can be seen. Derivations are illustrated by being children of the parent node, see section \ref{sec:parsetree} for more about parse trees.
