By using ANTLR, we get a parse tree, with a basic visitor, to work with. By expanding the basic visitor, two modified visitors have been made. The first visitor is for type checking, it will visit the parse tree to see if all the types are used together correctly. Errors will be put into a list and shown to the programmer. The second visitor will check for scoping errors and generate code from SPLAD into a language which can be used by Arduino.
