\subsection{Parse Tree}
A parse tree are nearly the same as a abstract syntax tree, but here all internal nodes are labeled with a non-terminal symbol and all leaves are labeled with a terminal symbol. A sub-tree describes one instance of an abstraction of a sentence.

To help understand the different between a abstract syntax tree seen on figure \ref{fig:abstract-syntax-tree} and a parse tree seen on figure \ref{fig:ParseTreeEKS}, two trees are made, one of each, over the same code for a variable declaration seen on listing \ref{lst:VariableDeclarationEKS} in the projects language.

\begin{code}{VariableDeclarationEKS}{A simple variable declaration in the project language.}
	\begin{lstlisting}
		int x <-- 3+2;
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{code}
