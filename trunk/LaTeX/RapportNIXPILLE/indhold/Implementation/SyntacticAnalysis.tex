\section{Syntactic Analysis}
\label{sec:syntactic}
Syntactic analysis is the first phase of the compilation process from SPLAD to the C/C++ like language Arduino uses. It consists of a lexer and a parser. These components are described in section \ref{sec:KnownLexersAndParsers}. The syntactic analyzer reads through the SPLAD program and checks if the program complies with the syntax specification of SPLAD and if it does, it creates a parse tree which is used by the contextual analysis.
