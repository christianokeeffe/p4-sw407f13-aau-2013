\section{Test of program written in SPLAD}
This section contains a description of how the SPLAD compiler was tested in practice. The Arduino platform is built as seen in figure \ref{fig:HWsetup}. This is the setup which was used as the test station. A basic test program (see appendix \ref{chap:apptestprog}) was written, which implemented various ingredients and drinks. As it can be seen in figure \ref{fig:HWsetup}, no actual ingredients was used, instead a number of LED's were installed to act as containers of ingredients. When an LED is on, it means that the ingredient which is represented by the LED is added to the drink. The test was a success, and confirmed that all the input buttons, the RFID-reader/writer, the LED's as well as the LCD worked as intended, and the SPLAD compiler compiled the code, which could be compiled to the Arduino platform without problems.
