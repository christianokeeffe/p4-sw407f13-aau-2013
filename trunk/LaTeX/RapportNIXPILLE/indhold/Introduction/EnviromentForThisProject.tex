 \section{Environment for this Project}
The environment in this project is an Arduino-based drinks-machine. The basic idea behind this environment, is that the drinks-machine resides in a bar or at a party, where customers will buy RFID-tags\footnote{RFID is a system that uses radio waves to read different encoded tags. See section \ref{sec:RFID} for more information.}, which contain the identifier of a specific drink. These RFID-tags will be read by the drinks-machine by using a RFID-reader. The machine will then automatically mix the drink, stored on the RFID-tag.
