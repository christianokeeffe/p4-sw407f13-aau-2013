The purpose of this report is to document the design and implementation of the programming language SPLAD and the appertaining compiler. SPLAD is a programming language designed for programming a drink-mixer based on the Arduino platform. The goal is to make a simple imperative programming language, fitted for the hobby programmer who will build a drink-mixer. The syntax of SPLAD will be specified in a way, so it has a high grade of readability. The semantics of SPLAD will be defined, and based on the semantics and syntax a compiler will be made. The compiler will compile the SPLAD program to the C-like programming language for Arduino.
