The purpose of this report is to document the design and implementation of the programming language SPLAD\footnote{\textbf{S}imple \textbf{P}ramming \textbf{L}anguage for \textbf{A}rduino \textbf{D}rink-mixer} and its compiler. SPLAD is a programming language designed for programming a drink-mixer based on the Arduino platform. The goal is to make a simple imperative programming language, fitted for the hobbyist programmer who wants to build a drink-mixer. The syntax of SPLAD will be specified in a way, so it has a high degree of readability. The semantics of SPLAD will be defined, and based on the syntax and semantics, a compiler will be made. The compiler will compile the SPLAD program to the C-like programming language for Arduino.
