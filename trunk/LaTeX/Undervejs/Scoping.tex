\section{Scoping}
When talking about scoping you generally differ between static and dynamic scoping. 

\begin{code}{code:StaticDynamicScoping}{A simple code showing the difference between static and dynamic scoping.}
\begin{listing}
const int b = 5;
int foo()
{
	int a = b + 5;
	return a;
}

int bar()
{
	int b = 2;
	return foo();
}

int main()
{
	foo();
	bar();
	return 0;
}
\end{listing}
\end{code}

The code \ref{code:StaticDynamicScoping} will in both cases return 10 in the foo() function, but in bar() the result will differ. With static scoping the bar() function will return 10 while with dynamic scoping it will return 7. 








\subsection{Scoping in our Project}
In our project we have chosen to use static scoping.
