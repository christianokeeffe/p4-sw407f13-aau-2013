\section{Paradigms of programming language}
In computer science, four main paradigms of programming languages exists \citep{ProgrammingParadigms}. In this section these paradigms will be shortly described followed by a subsection, explaining the choice of programming paradigm of the language in this project.

\subsection{Imperative Programming}
Imperative programming is a very sequential or procedural way to program, in the sense that this step is performed, then that step and so on. These steps are controlled by control-structures for example the if-statement. An example of a imperative programming language is C. Imperative programming language describes programs in terms of statements which alter the program state. This makes imperative languages very simple, and are also a good starting point for new programmers. 

\subsection{Functional Programming}
Functional programming originates from the theory of functions in mathematics. In functional programming all computations are done by calling functions. In functional programming languages calls to a function will always yield the same result, if the function are called with the same parameters as input. This is in contrast to imperative programming where function calls can result in different values depending on the state of the program at that given time. Some examples of functional programming languages are Haskell and OCaml. 

\subsection{Logic Programming}
Logic programming is fundamentally different from the imperative-, functional-, and object-oriented programming languages. In logic programming, one cannot state how a result should be computed, but rather the form and characteristics of the result. An example of a logic programming language is Prolog. 

\subsection{Object-Oriented Programming}
Object-Oriented programming is based on the idea of data encapsulation, and grouping of logical program aspects. The concept of parsing messages between objects are also a very desirable feature when programs become of certain size. In object-oriented programming, each class of object can be given methods, which is a kind of functions which can be called on that object. For example the expression "foo.Equals(bar)", would call the Equals-method in the class of 'foo', and evaluate if 'bar' equals 'foo'. It is also easy in object-oriented languages to specify access-levels of classes, and thereby protect certain classes from external exposure.  Classes can inherit form other classes. For example one could have a 'Car'-class, which inherits all properties and methods of a 'Vehicle'-class. This allows for a high degree of code-reuse. 

\subsection{Choice of Paradigm in This Project}
For this project, an imperative approach has been chosen. The reason for this is that the programming language of this project should be very easy to understand for newcomers to programming. Also the programs in this programming language will likely remain of a relatively small length, which does not make object-orienting desired.
