\section{Intro to Theory Section}
To better being able to work with the Arduino platform and develop a fitting language for the platform. It would be wise to look into the platform and see how it actually works. Therefore this section will cover the technology parts of the Arduino system and how it works. In this covering there will looked at already exiting language and what tools these languages provides their users with  Arduino's structure.

There will in this section also be looked into what a language actually is, the different principles behind designing a language is and what the different paradigms is. 
Compilers and translators will also be a subject that will be covered, their structure, the process of compiling and the different phases in the process.
